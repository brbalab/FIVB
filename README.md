# Numerical procedures used in optimization and display of the results in the paper
"FIVB ranking: misstep in the right direction"
the code is activated/desactivated using True/False statement

How to use : 
1. run the file FIVB_calculation.py to generate the files with the ranking results (this may take a couple of minutes because we run the results in non-optimal code and for many values of the step size)
2. run the file FIVB_paper_figures.py to display data which can be found in Table 4 and Table 5
